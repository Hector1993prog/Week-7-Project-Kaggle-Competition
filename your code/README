The following project was a test to imporve our skills in Machine learning.
With a really complex data base, my team and I developed a series of test to contrast if there was any possible solution or correlation to build-up a prediction model.
In this folder you will find the following:

1. Functions file used.
2. CSV data base
3. Main jupyter notebook with the findings.
4. the html report developed for the data base.
